Collaboratively, we could target federal contracts focused on advanced materials for defense applications, particularly those emphasizing low-observable technologies and electronic warfare resilience. The partnership could leverage Conductive Composites' capabilities in creating ready-to-field products that utilize Kenai Defense's stealth coatings, positioning us for opportunities in projects such as the U.S. Army's modernization initiatives or Navy's advanced surface and subsurface vessels program. A compelling proposal could highlight the dual benefits of radar absorption and electromagnetic shielding, showcasing how this innovative composite solution would enhance mission survivability across multiple domains.

To approach Conductive Composites, it would be advantageous to emphasize the growing demand for stealth technologies in defense applications and the advantages of combining the stealth coating with their conductive materials. Highlighting potential projects such as the Department of Defense's focus on next-gen military technologies, as well as their NAICS codes related to Advanced Materials (332812 for Metal Coating, Engraving, and Allied Services to Manufacturers or 325510 for Paint and Coating Manufacturing), will demonstrate the relevance and fit for collaboration. This partnership could ultimately lead to a robust offering that stands out in competitive federal contracting environments.
